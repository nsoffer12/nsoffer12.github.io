<h1>Activities That I Enjoy</h1>
<p> I enjoy many activities. Besides for being devoted to my academic studies, I love to learn new things about the world around us. I also enjoy playing sports, like basketball and football. I also like to watch TV on my free time. Lastly, I really enjoy playing backgammon. It is a common game not only in my home, but in the community.
