<h1>My Coding Experience</h1>
<p>	    Honestly, I have very little coding experience. For that reason, I am thankful for this program that MDYHS has provided for their students. I am hoping to be a full coder by the time this program is over. Besides for learning HTML and CSS, one of my good friends, named Jack Hedaya, is teaching some of my friends and I how to code using a language named Swift.
