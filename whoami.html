<h1>Solves The Mystery Of Who I Am</h1>
<p> My name is Ness Soffer. I am 14 years old and in Magen David Yeshivah High School in Brooklyn, New York. I live in a Jewish community that has been flourishing since the 1900â€™s. With great gratification, I have a great education, great friends, a peaceful household and all my necessities are provided for me. I am looking forward to a bright and successful future.
